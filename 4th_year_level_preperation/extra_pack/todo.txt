OS questions : 

1. What is process ?
- Process is program in execution. 
2. What is difference between process and threads? 
- Threads are the part of process and share the virtual address space of the process.Threads are lightweight
  becasue overhead of creating thread is less compared to process.
  Communication between process is costly.
  
3. What is semaphore ?
  Semaphore allows process and threads to synchronize their actions. The semaphore is an integer value 
  and allowed to be falldown below zero.

4. What is paging?
  
5. What is demand paging?
6. What is scheduling?
7. What are different types of scheduling?
   FCFS 
   SJF 
   Priority Scheduling 
   Round Robin Scheduling 
   Multilevel queue scheduling 
   Multilevel feedback Queue scheduling
